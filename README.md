# Predicting-fraudulent-firms

Several machine learning regressors and classifiers are explored, implemented, and tested to check their applicability in the prediction of the high risk firms. The rationale is to build a classification model that can predict the fraudulent firm on the basis of the present and historical risk factors.

There are two csv files : audit_risk and trail to present data. We have considered Audit_Risk as the target columns for regression tasks, and Risk as the target column for classification tasks.
